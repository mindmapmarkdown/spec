# Changelog

What changed in the specification, and in which release. Version numbers, bump
rules, and the release procedure are in [`VERSIONING.md`](VERSIONING.md); the
change classes referred to below are defined in [`GOVERNANCE.md`
§3](GOVERNANCE.md#3-classes-of-change).

Only [`spec.md`](spec.md) and the suite generated from it are versioned. Entries
for `docs/**` and `tools/**` appear here only where they change what the suite
tests or how a rule is read.

## Unreleased

**Nothing is released yet.** There is no tag, no version number, and nothing
conforms. Everything below is the state `main` has reached on the way to 0.1.0.

### Added

- **Chapter 1** — scope, conforming documents and implementations, the
  conformance ladder, terminology, and the design constraints the rest of the
  specification is held to.
- **Chapter 2** — the rules that decide which tree a document denotes and which
  document a tree denotes: 30 rules labelled `L-`, `S-`, `P-`, and `E-`.
- **The tree encoding used by examples** (§2.6). Examples state an expected tree,
  and the notation they state it in has to be specified or two implementations
  read the same suite differently.
- **A generated conformance suite.** [`examples/examples.json`](examples/examples.json)
  is extracted from the examples written inline in `spec.md` and is never
  hand-edited, so the specification and its tests cannot drift apart.
- **`P-10`** — a node's `content` is written before any of its children. Implied
  by `L-3` and stated because the failure it prevents is silent
  ([#23](https://github.com/mindmapmarkdown/spec/issues/23)).

### Changed

- **Node identity is no longer defined**, and conformance level **L2 (Identity)
  is removed**; the level that was L3 becomes L2 with its requirements unchanged.
  Identity as merged could not be assigned deterministically, which made every
  example in the suite unwritable — not only the ones about identity. RFC
  [0016](rfcs/0016-remove-node-identity.md), accepted 2026-08-27.
- **The heading/list distinction is part of the tree**, not a spelling of it:
  every node carries a `kind`, either `section` or `item`. RFC
  [0004](rfcs/0004-canonical-hierarchy.md), accepted 2026-08-10.
- **Example coverage** raised from 6 rules to 26 of 29 — 18 examples. Every
  expected tree is checked against an independent CommonMark parse. `S-1`, `S-2`,
  and `S-3` remain untested and cannot be tested in this format: they constrain
  trees, and lift cannot produce a tree that violates them.

### Open before 0.1.0

A release cannot be cut while a Normative question is undecided, because deciding
it afterwards makes it Breaking rather than Normative.

|---|---|
| [#17](https://github.com/mindmapmarkdown/spec/issues/17) | Front matter lifts to a spurious `section` node. Proposed by RFC [0022](rfcs/0022-front-matter-root-content.md), **comment period ends 2026-09-09** |
| [#19](https://github.com/mindmapmarkdown/spec/issues/19) | What `E-5`'s `block` names, and what a code block's `source` contains. The first half is Clarifying and waits on 0022, which amends the same sentence; the second is Normative and needs its own RFC |
